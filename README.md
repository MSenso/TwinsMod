# TwinsMod
The Twins mod for The Sims 4.

This mod automatically identifies twins in an active household via these filters:
- Equal Age stage
- Equal Age stage progress (sims lived equal amount of days)
- Same gender (though there will be some behaviour for different gender sims in the future)
- Appearance similarity is no less than 75% (otherwise they are just fraternal twins. There also will be some behabiour for them)

Next changes:
- Twin trait
- Twin social interactions and buffs
- Cheats to manually append twin relationship bit and trait for selected sims
- Different gender twins behaviour
- Fraternal twins behaviour
